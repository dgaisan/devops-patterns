# Multi Stage Build Template
- `compileStage` stage builds an executable from golang source
- Final stage runs the executable
- Base golang image layer removed at a final stage making the resulting image smaller (based on alpine)

## Build image
`docker build -t go-app .`

## Run the container
`docker run go-app`
